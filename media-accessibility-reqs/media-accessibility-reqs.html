			<p>This document aggregates the accessibility requirements of users with disabilities that
    the W3C HTML5 Accessibility Task Force has collected with respect to audio
    and video on the Web. </p>
    <p>It first provides an introduction to the needs of users with disabilities
    in relation to audio and video.</p>
			<p>Then it explains what alternative content technologies have been developed
    to help such users gain access to the content of audio and video. </p>
			<p>A third section explains how these content technologies fit in the larger
    picture of accessibility, both technically within a web user agent
    and from a production process point of view. </p>
			<p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline user agent
    or authoring tool requirements. It is important to recognize that not all
    user agents (nor all authoring tools) will support all the features discussed
    in this document. Rather, this document attempts to supply a comprehensive
    collection of user requirements needed to support media accessibility in
    the context of HTML5. As such, it should be expected that this document
    will continue to develop for some time. </p>
			<p>Please also note this document is not an inventory of technology currently
    provided by, or missing from HTML5 specification drafts. Technology is listed
    here because it's important for accommodating the alternative access
    needs of users with disabilities to web-based media. This document is an
    inventory of Media Accessibility User Requirements. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd">
        <p>This document is reasonably stable, and represents a consensus within the Working Group.  The Working Group is looking for
        feedback prior to publication as a Note.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Media Accessibility Checklist </h2>
			<p>The following User Requirements have also been distilled into a <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Accessibility_Checklist">Media Accessibility Checklist</a>.
			Developers and implementers may want to refer to this checklist when
			implementing audio and video content and features.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Accessible Media Requirements by Type of Disability </h2>

            <p>Editorial note: This section is a rough draft. It will be edited to align with

    <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html">How
    People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> once that document is complete.
    This draft is included now provide general background
    for sections 2 and 3 of this document. </p>
			<p>Comprehension of media may be affected by loss of visual function, loss
            of audio function, cognitive issues, or a combination of all three.
            Cognitive disabilities may affect access to and/or
    comprehension of media. Physical disabilities such as dexterity impairment,
    loss of limbs, or loss of use of limbs may affect access to media. Once richer
    forms of media, such as virtual reality, become more commonplace, tactile
    issues may come into play. Control of the media player can be an important
    issue, e.g., for people with physical disabilities, however this is typically not addressed
    by the media formats themselves, but is a requirement of the technology used
    to build the player. </p>
			<section>
				<h3> Blindness </h3>
				<p>People who are blind cannot access information if it is presented only
      in the visual mode. They require information in an alternative representation,
      which typically means the audio mode, although information can also be
      presented as text. It is important to remember that not only the main video
      is inaccessible, but any other visible ancillary information such as stock
      tickers, status indicators, or other on-screen graphics, as well as any
      visual controls needed to operate the content. Since people who are blind
      use a screen reader and/or refreshable braille display, these assistive
      technologies (ATs) need to work hand-in-hand with the access mechanism
      provided for the media content. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Low vision </h3>
				<p>People with low vision can use some visual information.
      Depending on their visual
      ability they might have specific issues such as difficulty discriminating
      foreground information from background information, or discriminating colors.
      Glare caused by excessive scattering in the eye can be a significant problem,
      especially for very bright content or surroundings. They may be unable
      to react quickly to transient information, and may have a narrow angle
      of view and so may not detect key information presented temporarily where
      they are not looking, or in text that is moving or scrolling. A person
      using a low-vision AT aid, such as a screen magnifier, will only be viewing
      a portion of the screen, and so must manage tracking media content via
      their AT. They may have difficulty reading when text is too small, has
      poor background contrast, or when outline or other fancy font types or
      effects are used. They may be using an AT that adjusts all the colors of
      the screen, such as inverting the colors, so the media content must be
      viewable through the AT. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Atypical color perception </h3>
				<p>A significant percentage of the population has atypical color perception,
      and may not be able to discriminate between different colors, or may miss
      key information when coded with color only. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Deafness </h3>
				<p>People who are deaf generally cannot use audio. Thus, an alternative representation
      is required, typically through synchronized captions and/or sign translation. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Hard of hearing </h3>
				<p>People who are hard of hearing may be able to use some audio material,
      but might not be able to discriminate certain types of sound, and may miss
      any information presented as audio only if it contains frequencies they
      can't hear, or is masked by background noise or distortion. They may miss
      audio which is too quiet, or of poor quality. Speech may be problematic
      if it is too fast and cannot be played back more slowly. Information presented
      using multichannel audio (e.g., stereo) may not be perceived by people
      who are deaf in one ear. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Deaf-blind </h3>
				<p>Individuals who are deaf-blind have a combination of conditions that may
      result in one of the following: blindness and deafness; blindness and difficulty
      in hearing; low vision and deafness; or low vision and difficulty in hearing.
      Depending on their combination of conditions, individuals who are deaf-blind
      may need captions that can be enlarged, changed to high-contrast colors,
      or otherwise styled; or they may need captions and/or described video that
      can be presented with AT (e.g., a refreshable braille display). They may
      need synchronized captions and/or described video, or they may need a non-time-based
      transcript which they can read at their own pace. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Physical impairment </h3>
				<p>People with physical disabilities such as poor dexterity, loss of limbs, or
      loss of use of limbs may use the keyboard alone rather than the combination
      of a pointing device plus keyboard to interact with content and controls,
      or may use a switch with an on-screen keyboard, or other assistive technology.
      The player itself must be usable via the keyboard and pointing
      devices. The user must have full access to all player controls, including
      methods for selecting alternative content. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Cognitive and neurological disabilities </h3>
				<p>Cognitive and neurological disabilities include a wide range of conditions
      that may include intellectual disabilities (called learning disabilities
      in some regions), autism-spectrum disorders, memory impairments, mental-health
      disabilities, attention-deficit disorders, audio- and/or visual-perceptive
      disorders, dyslexia and dyscalculia (called learning disabilities in some
      regions), or seizure disorders. Necessary accessibility supports vary widely
      for these different conditions. Individuals with some conditions may process
      information aurally better than by reading text; therefore, information
      that is presented as text embedded in a video should also be available
      as audio descriptions. Individuals with other conditions may need to reduce
      distractions or flashing in presentations of video. Some conditions such
      as autism-spectrum disorders may have multi-system effects and individuals
      may need a combination of different accommodation.
					Overall, the media experience for people on the autism spectrum should
        be customizable and well designed so as to not be overwhelming. Care
        must be taken to present a media experience that focuses on the purpose
        of the content and provides alternative content in a clear, concise manner. </p>
      <!--
				<section>
					<h4> Autism </h4>
					<p>Individuals with an autism-spectrum disorder are commonly impacted in
        the areas of communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors.
        They can have difficulty interpreting and expressing social communication,
        as well as difficulty shifting between context and activities. Therefore,
        a supplemental content track could be used to focus the individual’s
        attention on the key points of the media. For example, supplemental text
        could point out the key educational messages or plainly state the meaning
        of social interactions. Verbal communications could be broken down into
        the key messages; tone of voice could be interpreted; phrases of speech
        and communication styles such as sarcasm could be explained. </p>
					<p>Individuals on the autism spectrum can be quite visual and learn effectively
        from social stories. A social story is a simple description of a social
        situation, such as an upcoming event, a social interaction, or a change
        in routine. A social story is commonly a series of pictures, supported
        by simple text to describe the actions, behavior, and outcomes. This
        technique could be carried over to media by providing a social story
        as alternative content. The media of the social story could be a combination
        of pictures and synchronized text or audio. </p>
					<p>Overall, the media experience for people on the autism spectrum should
        be customizable and well designed so as to not be overwhelming. Care
        must be taken to present a media experience that focuses on the purpose
        of the content and provides alternative content in a clear, concise manner. </p>

		<section>
			<h2> Alternative Content Technologies </h2>
			<p>A number of alternative content types have been developed to help users
    with sensory disabilities gain access to audio-visual content. This section
    lists them, explains generally what they are, and provides a number of requirements
    on each that need to be satisfied with technology developed in HTML5 around
    the media elements. </p>
			<section>
				<h3> Described video </h3>
				<p>Described video contains descriptive narration of key visual elements
      designed to make visual media accessible to people who are blind or visually
      impaired. The descriptions include actions, costumes, gestures, scene changeset
      or any other important visual information that someone who cannot see the
      screen might ordinarily miss. Descriptions are traditionally audio recordings
      timed and recorded to fit into natural pauses in the program, although
      they may also briefly obscure the main audio track. (See the section on
      extended descriptions for an alternative approach.) The descriptions are
      usually read by a narrator with a voice that cannot be easily confused
      with other voices in the primary audio track. They are authored to convey
      objective information (e.g., a yellow flower) rather than subjective judgments
      (e.g., a beautiful flower). </p>
				<p>As with captions, descriptions can be open or closed. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Open descriptions</strong> are merged with the program-audio
        track and cannot be turned off by the viewer. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Closed descriptions</strong> can be turned on and off by the
        viewer. They can be recorded as a separate track containing descriptions
        only, timed to play at specific spots in the timeline and played in parallel
        with the program-audio track. </li>
					<li> Some descriptions can be delivered as a <strong>separate audio</strong> channel
        mixed in at the player. </li>
					<li> Other options include a computer-generated <strong>‘text to speech’
          track,</strong> also known as text video descriptions. This is described
          in the next subsection. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Described video provides benefits that reach beyond blind or visually
      impaired viewers; e.g., students grappling with difficult materials or
      concepts. Descriptions can be used to give supplemental information about
      what is on screen—the structure of lengthy mathematical equations or the
      intricacies of a painting, for example. </p>
				<p>Described video is available on some television programs and in many movie
      theaters in the U.S. and other countries. Regulations in the U.S. and Europe
      are increasingly focusing on description, especially for television, reflecting
      its priority with citizens who have visual impairments. The technology
      needed to deliver and render basic video descriptions is in fact relatively
      straightforward, being an extension of common audio-processing solutions.
      Playback products must support multi-audio channels required for description,
      and any product dealing with broadcast TV content must provide adequate
      support for descriptions. Descriptions can also provide text that can be
      indexed and searched. </p>
				<p>Systems supporting described video that are not open descriptions must: </p>

			<section>
				<h3> Text video description </h3>
				<p>Described video that uses text for the description source rather than
      a recorded voice creates specific requirements. </p>
				<p>Text video descriptions (TVDs) are delivered to the client as text and
      rendered locally by assistive technology such as a screen reader or a braille
      device. This can have advantages for screen-reader users who want full
      control of the preferred voice and speaking rate, or other options to control
      the speech synthesis. </p>
				<p>Text video descriptions are provided as text files containing start times
      for each description cue. Since the duration that a screen reader takes
      to read out a description cannot be determined during authoring of the
      cues, it is difficult to ensure they don't obscure the main audio or other
      description cues. This is likely to be caused by at least three reasons: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> An author of text video descriptions does not have a screen reader.
        This means s/he cannot check if the description fits within the time
        frame. Even if s/he has a screen reader, a user's screen reader will
        be set to a different reading speed and may take longer to read the same
        sentence. </li>
					<li> Some screen-reader users (e.g., those who are elderly or have learning
        disabilities) may slow down the speech rate. </li>
					<li> A visually complicated scene (e.g., figures on a blackboard in an
        online physics class) may require more description time than is available
        in the program-audio track. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Systems supporting text video descriptions must: </p>
				<section>
					<h4 id="TVD-1"><strong class="req-handle">[TVD-1]</strong> Support presentation of text video descriptions through
          a screen reader or braille device, with playback speed control and
          voice control and synchronisation points with the video. </h4>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="TVD-2"><strong class="req-handle">[TVD-2]</strong> TVDs need to be provided in a format that contains the following
          information:</h4>
				</section>
				<ol class="list-in-req">
					<li>start time, text per description cue (the duration is determined
              dynamically, though an end time could provide a cut point) </li>
					<li>possibly a speech-synthesis markup to improve quality of
              the description (existing speech synthesis markups include <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">SSML</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/">CSS 3 Speech Module</a>) </li>
					<li>accompanying metadata providing labeling for speakers, language,

					<h4 id="TVD-3"><strong class="req-handle">[TVD-3]</strong> Where possible, provide a text or separate audio track privately

				</section>

					<h4 id="TVD-4"><strong class="req-handle">[TVD-4]</strong> Where possible, provide options for authors and users to

          the video. (One solution from a user's point of view may be to pause
          the video and finish reading the TVD, for example.) User preference
          should override authored option. </h4>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="TVD-5"><strong class="req-handle">[TVD-5]</strong> Support the control over speech-synthesis playback speed,
          volume and voice, and provide synchronisation points with the video. </h4>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3> Extended video descriptions </h3>
				<p>Video descriptions are usually provided as recorded speech, timed to play
      in the natural pauses in dialog or narration. In some types of material,
      however, there is not enough time to present sufficient descriptions. To
      meet such cases, the concept of extended description was developed. Extended
      descriptions work by pausing the video and program audio at key moments,
      playing a longer description than would normally be permitted, and then
      resuming playback when the description is finished playing. This will naturally
      extend the timeline of the entire presentation. This procedure has not
      been possible in broadcast television; however, hard-disk recording and
      on-demand Internet systems can make this a practical possibility. </p>
				<p>Extended video description (EVD) has been reported to have benefits for
      cognitive disabilities; for example, it might benefit people with Aspergers
      Syndrome and other Autistic Spectrum Disorders, in that it can make connections

				<h3> Clean audio </h3>
				<p>A relatively recent development in television accessibility is the concept
      of <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101100_101199/101154/01.09.01_60/ts_101154v010901p.pdf">clean
      audio</a>, which takes advantage of the increased adoption of multichannel
      audio. This is primarily aimed at audiences who are hard of hearing, and
      consists of isolating the audio channel containing the spoken dialog and
      important non-speech information that can then be amplified or otherwise
      modified, while other channels containing music or ambient sounds are attenuated. </p>
				<p>Using the isolated audio track may make it possible to apply more sophisticated
      audio processing such as pre-emphasis filters, pitch-shifting, and so on
      to tailor the audio to the user's needs, since hearing loss is typically
      frequency-dependent, and the user may have usable hearing in some bands
      yet none at all in others. </p>
				<p>Systems supporting clean audio and multiple audio tracks must: </p>
				<section>

				<h3> Content navigation by content structure </h3>
				<p>Most people are familiar with fast forward and rewind in media content.
      However, because they progress through content based only on time, fast
      forward and rewind are ineffective particularly when the content is being
      used for purposes other than entertainment. People with disabilities are
      also particularly disadvantaged if forced to rely solely on time-based
      fast forward and rewind to study content. </p>
				<p>Fortunately, most content is structured, and appropriate markup can expose
      this structure to forward and rewind controls: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Books generally have chapters and perhaps subsections within those
        chapters. They also have structures such as page numbers, side-bars,
        tables, footnotes, tables of contents, glossaries, etc. </li>
					<li> Short music selections tend to have verses and repeating choruses. </li>
					<li> Larger classical-music works have movements which are further dividable
        by component parts such as exposition, development and recapitulation,
        or theme and variations. </li>
					<li> Operas, theatrical plays, and movies have acts and scenes within those
        acts. </li>
					<li> Television programs generally have clear divisions; e.g., newscasts
        have individual stories usually wrapped within larger structures called
        news, weather, or sports. </li>
					<li> A lecturer may first lay out a topic, then consider a series of approaches
        or illustrative examples, and finally draw a conclusion. </li>
				</ul>
        <p>This is, of course, a hierarchical view of content. However, effective
				navigation of a multi-level hierarchy will require an additional control not
				typically available using current media players. This mechanism, which we are
				calling a &quot;granularity-level control,&quot; will allow the user to adjust the level
				of granularity applied to &quot;next&quot; and &quot;previous&quot; controls. This is necessary
				because next and previous are too cumbersome if accessing every node in a
				complex hierarchy, but unsatisfactorily broad and coarse if set to only the top
				level of the hierarchy. Allowing the user to adjust the granularity level that
				next and previous apply to has proven very effective&#x2014;hence the adjustable
				granularity level control.</p>
				<p><strong>Two examples of granularity levels</strong> </p>
				<p>1. In a news broadcast, the most global level (analogous to   &lt;h1&gt;)
      might be the category called &quot;news, weather, and sports.&quot;    The
      second level (analogous to &lt;h2&gt;) would identify each individual news
      (or sports) story. With the granularity control set to level 1, &quot;next&quot; and &quot;previous&quot; would
      cycle among news, weather, and sports. Set at level 2, it would cycle among
      individual news (or sports) stories. </p>
				<p>2. In a bilingual audiobook-plus-e-text production of Dante Alighieri's &quot;La
      Divina Commedia,&quot; the user would choose whether to listen to the original
      medieval Italian or its modern-language translation—possibly toggling
      between them. Meanwhile, both the original and translated texts might appear
      on screen, with both the original and translated text highlighted, line
      by line, in sync with the audio narration. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> The most global (&lt;h1&gt;) level would be each individual book— &quot;Inferno,&quot; &quot;Purgatorio,&quot; and &quot;Paradiso.&quot; </li>
					<li> The second (&lt;h2&gt;) level would be each individual canto. </li>
					<li> The third (&lt;h3&gt;) level would be each individual verso. </li>
					<li> The fourth (&lt;h4&gt;) level would be each individual line of poetry. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>With granularity set at level 1, &quot;next&quot; and &quot;previous&quot; would
      cycle among the three books of &quot;La Divina Commedia.&quot;  Set at
      level 2, they would cycle among its cantos, at level 3 among its versos,
      and at level 4 among the individual lines of poetry text. </p>
				<p><strong>Navigating ancillary content</strong> </p>
				<p>There is a kind of structure, particularly in longer media resources,
      which requires special navigational consideration. While present in the
      media resource, it does not fit in the natural beginning-to-end progression
      of the resource. Its consumption tends to interrupt this natural beginning-to-end
      progression. A familiar example is a footnote or sidebar in a book. One
      must pause reading the text narrative to read a footnote or sidebar. Yet
      these structures are important and might require their own alternative
      media renditions. We have chosen to call such structures &quot;ancillary
      content structures.&quot; </p>
				<p>Commercials, news briefs, weather updates, etc., are familiar examples
      from television programming. While so prevalent that most of us may be
      inured to it, they do function to interrupt the primary television program.
      Users will want the ability to navigate past these ancillary structures—or
      perhaps directly to them. </p>
				<p>E-text-plus-audio productions of titles such as &quot;La Divina Commedia,&quot; described
      above, may well include reproductions of famous frescoes or paintings interspersed
      throughout the text, though these are not properly part of the text/content.
      Such illustrations must be programatically discoverable by users. They
      also need to be described. However, the user needs the option of choosing
      when to pause for that interrupting description. </p>
				<p><strong>Additional note</strong> </p>
				<p>Media in HTML5 will be used heavily and broadly. These accessibility user
      requirements will often find broad applicability. </p>
				<p>Just as the structures introduced particularly by nonfiction titles make
      books more usable, media is more usable when its inherent structure is
      exposed by markup. Markup-based access to structure is critical for persons
      with disabilities who cannot infer structure from purely presentational
      queues. </p>
				<p>Structural navigation has proven highly effective in various programs
      of electronic book publication for persons with print disabilities. Nowadays,
      these programs are based on the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/daisy-standard">ANSI/NISO
      Z39.86 specifications</a>. Z39.86 structural navigation is also supported
      by <a href="http://www.idpf.org/">e-publishing industry specifications</a>. </p>
				<p>The user can navigate along the timebase using a continuous scale, and
      by relative time units within rendered audio and animations (including
      video and animated images) that last three or more seconds at their default
      playback rate. (UAAG 2.0 2.11.6) </p>
				<p>The user can navigate by semantic structure within the time-based media,
      such as by chapters or scenes, if present in the media (UAAG 2.0 2.11.7). </p>

				<h3> Captioning </h3>
				<p>For people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, captioning is a prime alternative
      representation of audio. Captions are in the same language as the main
      audio track and, in contrast to foreign-language subtitles, render a transcription
      of dialog or narration as well as important non-speech information, such
      as sound effects, music, and laughter. Historically, captions have been
      either closed or open. Closed captions have been transmitted as data along
      with the video but were not visible until the user elected to turn them
      on, usually by invoking an on-screen control or menu selection. Open captions
      have always been visible; they had been merged with the video track and
      could not be turned off. </p>
				<p>Ideally, captions should be a verbatim representation of the audio; however,
      captions are sometimes edited for various reasons— for example, for reading
      speed or for language level. In general, consumers of captions have expressed
      that the text should represent exactly what is in the audio track. If edited
      captions are provided, then they should be clearly marked as such, and
      the full verbatim version should also be available as an option. </p>
				<p>The timing of caption text can coincide with the mouth movement of the
      speaker (where visible), but this is not strictly necessary. For timing
      purposes, captions may sometimes precede or extend slightly after the audio
      they represent. Captioning should also use adequate means to distinguish
      between speakers as turn-taking occurs during conversation; this has in
      the past been done by positioning the text near the speaker, by associating
      different colors to different speakers, or by putting the name and a colon
      in front of the text line of a speaker. </p>
				<p>Captions are useful to a wide array of users in addition to their originally
      intended audiences. Gyms, bars and restaurants regularly employ captions
      as a way for patrons to watch television while in those establishments.
      People learning to read or learning the language of the country where they
      live as a second language also benefit from captions: research has shown
      that captions help reinforce vocabulary and language. Captions can also
      provide a powerful search capability, allowing users and search engines
      to search the caption text to locate a specific video or an exact point
      in a video. </p>
				<p>Formats for captions, subtitles or foreign-language subtitles must: </p>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-1"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-1]</strong> Render text in a time-synchronized manner,
          using the media resource as the timebase master. </h4>
					<p class="note">Most of the time, the main audio track would be the best candidate
        for the timebase. Where a video without audio, but with a text track,
        is available, the video track becomes the timebase master. Also, there
        may be situations where an explicit timing track is available. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-2"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-2]</strong> Allow the author to specify erasures, i.e.,
          times when no text is displayed on the screen (no text cues are active). </h4>
					<p class="note">This should be possible both within media resources and caption
      formats. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-3"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-3]</strong> Allow the author to assign timestamps so
          that one caption/subtitle follows another, with no perceivable gap
          in between. </h4>
					<p class="note">This means that caption cues should be able to either let the
        start time of the subsequent cue be determined by the duration of the
        cue or have the end time be implied by the start of the next cue. For
        overlapping captions, explicit start and end times are then required. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-4"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-4]</strong> Be available in a text encoding. </h4>
					<p class="note">This means that determined character encodings should be supported
        - which could be either by making the character encoding explicit or
        by enforcing a single default one such as UTF-8. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-5"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-5]</strong> Support positioning in all parts of the

          multiple captions are on screen at the same time and relate to different
          speakers, or when in-picture text is avoided. </h4>
					<p class="note">The minimum requirement is a bounding box (with an optional background)
        into which text is flowed, and that probably needs to be pixel aligned.
        The absolute position of text within the bounding box is less critical,
        although it is important to be able to avoid bad word-breaks and have
        adequate white space around letters and so on. There is more on this
        in a separate requirement. </p>
					<p>The caption format could provide a min-width/min-height for its bounding
        box, which typically is calculated from the bottom of the video viewport,
        but can be placed elsewhere by the web page, with the web page being
        able to make that box larger and scale the text relatively, too. The
        positions inside the box should probably be into regions, such as top,
        right, bottom, left, center. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-6"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-6]</strong> Support the display of multiple regions

					<p class="note">This typically relates to multiple text cues that are defined

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="CC-14"><strong class="req-handle">[CC-14]</strong> Allow the use of mixed display styles—

          usually one or two lines of captions that appear on screen and remain
          visible for one to several seconds before they disappear. Paint-on
          captions are individual characters that are &quot;painted on&quot; from
          left to right, not popped onto the screen all at once, and usually
          are verbatim. Another often-used caption style in live captioning is
          roll-up - here, cue text follows double chevrons (&quot;greater than&quot; symbols),
          and are used to indicate different speaker identifications. Each sentence &quot;rolls
          up&quot; to about three lines. The top line of the three disappears

				<h3> Enhanced captions/subtitles </h3>
				<p>Enhanced captions are timed text cues that have been enriched with further
      information - examples are glossary definitions for acronyms and other
      intialisms, foreign terms (for example, Latin), jargon or descriptions
      for other difficult language. They may be age-graded, so that multiple
      caption tracks are supplied, or the glossary function may be added dynamically
      through machine lookup. </p>
				<p>Glossary information can be added in the normal time allotted for the
      cue (e.g., as a callout or other overlay), or it might take the form of
      a hyperlink that, when activated, pauses the main content and allows access
      to more complete explanatory material. </p>
				<p>Such extensions can provide important additional information to the content
      that will enable or improve the understanding of the main content to users of assistive
      technology. Enhanced text cues will be particularly useful for those with restricted
      reading skills, to subtitle users, and to caption users. Users may often
      come across keywords in text cues that lend themselves to further in-depth
      information or hyperlinks, such as an e-mail contact or phone number for
      a person, a strange term that needs a link to a definition, or
      an idiom that needs comments to explain it to a foreign-language speaker. </p>
				<p>Systems that support enhanced captions must: </p>

					<p class="note">Such &quot;metadata&quot; markup can be realised through a @title
        attribute on a &lt;span&gt; of the text, or a hyperlink to another location
        where a term is explained, an &lt;abbr&gt; element, an   &lt;acronym&gt; element,

				<h3> Sign translation </h3>
				<p>Sign language shares the same concept as captioning: it presents both
      speech and non-speech information in an alternative format. Note that due
      to the wide regional variation in signing systems (e.g., American Sign
      Language vs British Sign Language), sign translation may not be appropriate
      for content with a global audience unless localized variants can be made
      available. </p>
				<p>Signing can be open, mixed with the video and offered as an entirely alternative
      stream or closed (using some form of picture-in-picture or alpha-blending
      technology). It is possible to use quite low bit rates for much of the
      signing track, but it is important that facial, arm, hand and other body
      gestures be delivered at sufficient resolution to support legibility. Animated
      avatars may not currently be sufficient as a substitute for human signers,
      although research continues in this area and it may become practical at
      some point in the future. </p>
				<p>Acknowledging that not all devices will be capable of handling multiple
      video streams, this is a SHOULD requirement for browsers where hardware
      is capable of support. Strong authoring guidance for content creators will
      mitigate situations where user-agents are unable to support multiple video
      streams (WCAG) - for example, on mobile devices that cannot support multiple
      streams, authors should be encouraged to offer two versions of the media
      stream, including one with signed captions burned into the media. </p>
				<p>Selecting from multiple tracks for different sign languages should be
      achieved in the same fashion that multiple caption/subtitle files are handled. </p>

          Parallel video here means two discrete videos playing in sync with
          each other. It is preferable to have one discrete   &lt;video&gt; element

				<p>While synchronized captions are generally preferable for people with hearing
      impairments, for some users they are not viable – those who are deaf-blind,
      for example, or those with cognitive or reading impairments that make it
      impossible to follow synchronized captions. And even with ordinary captions,
      it is possible to miss some information as the captions and the video require
      two separate loci of attention. The full transcript supports different
      user needs and is not a replacement for captioning. A transcript can either
      be presented simultaneously with the media material, which can assist slower
      readers or those who need more time to reference context, but it should
      also be made available independently of the media. </p>
				<p>A full text transcript should include information that would be in both
      the caption and video description, so that it is a complete representation

				<h3> Access to interactive controls / menus </h3>
				<p>Media elements offer a rich set of interaction possibilities to users.
      These interaction possibilities must be available to all users, including
      those that cannot use a pointer device for interaction. Further, these
      interaction possibilities must be available to all users for all means
      in which the controls are exposed - no matter whether they are exposed
      by the user agent, or are scripted. Further, the interaction possibilities
      need to be rich enough to allow all users fine grained control over media
      playback. </p>
				<p>It is imperative that controls be device independent, so that control
      may be achieved by keyboard, pointing device, speech, etc. </p>

				<h3> Production practice and resulting requirements </h3>
				<p>One of the biggest problems to date has been the lack of a universal system
      for media access. In response to user requirements various countries and
      groups have defined systems to provide accessibility, especially captioning
      for television. However these systems are typically not compatible. In
      some cases the formats can be inter-converted, but some formats — for example
      DVD sub-pictures — are image based and are difficult to convert to text. </p>
				<p>Caption formats are often geared towards delivery of the media, for example
      as part of a television broadcast. They are not well suited to the production
      phases of media creation. Media creators have developed their own internal
      formats which are more amenable to the editing phase, but to date there
      has been no common format that allows interchange of this data. </p>
				<p>Any media based solution should attempt to reduce as far as possible layers
      of translation between production and delivery. </p>
				<p>In general captioners use a proprietary workstation to prepare caption
      files; these can often export to various standard broadcast ingest formats,
      but in general files are not inter-convertible. Most video editing suites
      are not set up to preserve captioning, and so this has typically to be
      added after the final edit is decided on; furthermore since this work is
      often outsourced, the copyright holder may not hold the final editable
      version of the captions. Thus when programming is later re-purposed, e.g.
      a shorter edit is made, or a ‘directors cut’ produced, the captioning may
      have to be redone in its entirety. Similarly, and particularly for news
      footage, parts of the media may go to web before the final TV edit is made,
      and thus the captions that are produced for the final TV edit are not available
      for the web version. </p>
				<p>It is important when purchasing or commissioning media, that captioning
      and described video is taken into account and made equal priority in terms
      of ownership, rights of use, etc., as the video and audio itself. </p>
				<p>This is primarily an authoring requirement. It is understood that a
      common time-stamp format must be declared in HTML5, so that authoring tools
      can conform to a required output. </p>
				<p>Systems supporting accessibility needs for media must: </p>
				<section>
					<h4 id="PP-1"><strong class="req-handle">[PP-1]</strong> Support existing production practice for alternative content
          resources, in particular allow for the association of separate alternative
          content resources to media resources. Browsers cannot support all forms
          of time-stamp formats out there, just as they cannot support all forms
          of image formats (etc.). This necessitates a clear and unambiguous
          declared format, so that existing authoring tools can be configured
          to export finished files in the required format. </h4>

          related accessibility content inside the media wrapper (for example
          an MP4 file), then it will require an appropriate third-party authoring
          tool to make changes to that file - it cannot be demanded of the browser
          to do so. </h4>

				<h3> Discovery and activation/deactivation of available alternative content
      by the user </h3>
				<p>As described above, individuals need a variety of media (alternative content)
      in order to perceive and understand the content. The author or some web
      mechanism provides the alternative content. This alternative content may
      be part of the original content, embedded within the media container as
      'fallback content', or linked from the original content. The user is faced
      with discovering the availability of alternative content. </p>
				<p>Alternative content must be both discoverable by the user, and accessible
      in device agnostic ways. The development of APIs and user-agent controls
      should adhere to the following UAAG guidance: </p>

      any required accessibility options. For user agents supporting accessibility
      APIs implemented for a platform, any media controls need to be connected
      to that API. </p>
				<p>On self-contained products that do not support assistive technology, any
      menus in the content need to provide information in alternative formats
      (e.g., talking menus). Products with a separate remote control, or that
      are self-contained boxes, should ensure the physical design does not block
      access, and should make accessibility controls, such as the closed-caption
      toggle, as prominent as the volume or channel controls. </p>

				<h3> Requirements on the use of the viewport </h3>
				<p>The video viewport plays a particularly important role with respect to
      alternative-content technologies. Mostly it provides a bounding box for
      many of the visually represented alternative-content technologies (e.g.,
      captions, hierarchical navigation points, sign language), although some
      alternative content does not rely on a viewport (e.g., full transcripts,
      descriptive video). </p>
				<p>One key principle to remember when designing player ‘skins’ is that the
      lower-third of the video may be needed for caption text. Caption consumers
      rely on being able to make fast eye movements between the captions and
      the video content. If the captions are in a non-standard place, this may
      cause viewers to miss information. The use of this area for things such
      as transport controls, while appealing aesthetically, may lead to accessibility
      conflicts. </p>
				<section>
					<h4 id="VP-1"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-1]</strong> It must be possible to deal with three different
          cases for the relation between the viewport size, the position of media
          and of alternative content:</h4>
					<ol class="list-in-req">
						<li>the alternative content's extent is specified in relation
              to the media viewport (e.g., picture-in-picture video, lower-third
              captions) </li>
						<li>the alternative content has its own independent extent,
              but is positioned in relation to the media viewport (e.g., captions
              above the audio, sign-language video above the audio, navigation
              points below the controls) </li>
						<li>the alternative content has its own independent extent and
              doesn't need to be rendered in any relation to the media viewport
              (e.g., text transcripts) </li>
					</ol>
					<p>If alternative content has a different height or width than the media
        content, then the user agent will reflow the (HTML) viewport. (UAAG 2.0
        1.8.7). </p>
					<p class="note">This may create a need to provide an author hint to the web page
        when embedding alternative content in order to instruct the web page how
        to render the content: to scale with the media resource, scale independently,
        or provide a position hint in relation to the media. On small devices
        where the video takes up the full viewport, only limited rendering choices
        may be possible, such that the UA may need to override author preferences. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="VP-2"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-2]</strong> The user can change the following characteristics
          of visually rendered text content, overriding those specified by the
          author or user-agent defaults (UAAG 2.0 1.4.1). (Note: this should
          include captions and any text rendered in relation to media elements,
          so as to be able to magnify and simplify rendered text):</h4>
					<ol class="list-in-req">
						<li>text scale (i.e., the general size of text), </li>
						<li>font family, and </li>
						<li>text color (i.e., foreground and background). </li>
					</ol>
					<p class="note">This should be achievable through UA configuration or even through
        something like a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">greasemonkey script</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#usercss">user
        CSS</a> which can override styles dynamically in the browser. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="VP-3"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-3]</strong> Provide the user with the ability to adjust
          the size of the time-based media up to the full height or width of
          the containing viewport, with the ability to preserve aspect ratio
          and to adjust the size of the playback viewport to avoid cropping,
          within the scaling limitations imposed by the media itself. (UAAG 2.0
          1.8.9) </h4>
					<p class="note">This can be achieved by simply zooming into the web page, which
      will automatically rescale the layout and reflow the content. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="VP-4"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-4]</strong> Provide the user with the ability to control
          the contrast and brightness of the content within the playback viewport.
          (UAAG 2.0 2.11.8) </h4>
					<p class="note">This is a user-agent device requirement and should already be
        addressed in the UAAG. In live content, it may even be possible to adjust
        camera settings to achieve this requirement. It is also a   &quot;SHOULD&quot; level
        requirement, since it does not account for limitations of various devices. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="VP-5"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-5]</strong> Captions and subtitles traditionally occupy
          the lower third of the video, where controls are also usually
          rendered. The user agent must avoiding overlapping of overlay content
          and controls on media resources. This must also happen if, for example,
          the controls are only visible on demand. </h4>
					<p class="note">If there are several types of overlapping overlays, the controls
        should stay on the bottom edge of the viewport and the others should
        be moved above this area, all stacked above each other. </p>
				</section>

				<h3> Requirements on secondary screens and other devices </h3>
				<p>Multiple user devices must be directly addressable. It must be assumed
      that many users will have multiple video displays and/or multiple audio-output
      devices attached to an individual computer, or addressable via LAN. It
      must be possible to configure certain types of media for presentation on
      specific devices, and these configuration settings must be readily overwritable
      on a case-by-case basis by users. </p>
